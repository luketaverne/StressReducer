# StressReducer
You're here because you applied to the NSF GRFP. If you have python installed,
along with the BeautifulSoup, urllib2 packages, you can use this program
to alert you if you win. Just set up cron to run this script while you're
sleeping, put your speakers on and make sure your computer doesn't go to sleep,
and it will open your celebratory music video if you win.

Good luck everyone.
